deck of cards workout game

This program creates a workout routine based on the 52 cards in a deck. 
One exercise from four different groups is randomly assigned to a suit.
Then the cards are "flipped" and the number of times to do that exercise is stated. 

There is a low alternate program, that takes the smaller numbers and assigns them "harder" exercises, 
  like pull-ups, as an extra challenge.
